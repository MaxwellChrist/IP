This project was made possible by frontendmentor.io. I wanted to refresh my React skills as well as practice making promises without axios. I completed the IP address tracker on their website and this is my finished product. There were a few things I improvised that I thought were neat. First, if you click on the button without a valid submission at the start, you'll get your own IP address instead of the default location I used. Also, there was nothing I saw that showed how to handle errors, so I created a couple components and had them show depending on the information returned from the promise. I did this using the ternary operator a couple of times and it worked out well. To see a snapshot of this project, check out my video below:
